## üìñ Lessons Learned

**Reddit Joke Scraper** has been a really fun project. It's always amazing to start your programming with a bunch of laughter. This tool did just that.

But I made this tool to create a reliable Dad-Jokes and Puns dataset that I couldn't find anywhere else. This automated the process of maintaining such a dataset.

This tool has been used directly for another project of mine . . . coming soon!

I learnt many things along the way, the most notable ones are mentioned below -

- Reddit API
- PRAW
- ANSI printing and deletion
- **and so much more...**
